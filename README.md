**Overview

The Disease Recommendation System is a machine learning-based web application developed using Flask. It predicts diseases based on user symptoms and provides recommendations, including suggested diets and precautions for better health management.

**Features

Symptom-Based Disease Prediction: Users can input symptoms, and the system predicts the most probable disease.

Diet Recommendations: Provides suitable dietary suggestions for the predicted disease.

Precautionary Measures: Offers preventive steps to manage and reduce the severity of the condition.

User-Friendly Interface: Simple and interactive web interface for easy use.

**Technologies Used

Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for model training)

Flask (For backend development)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (For frontend)

Pandas & NumPy (For data handling)


**Dataset

The system uses a dataset containing symptoms, diseases, corresponding diet recommendations, and precautionary measures. The dataset is processed and used to train a machine learning model.

**How It Works

User Input: Enter symptoms in the web interface.

Disease Prediction: The trained model predicts the disease.

Recommendations: The system provides dietary suggestions and precautions based on the predicted disease.


**Future Enhancements

Adding a chatbot for interactive symptom assessment.

Enhancing prediction accuracy with deep learning models.

Mobile application support.
